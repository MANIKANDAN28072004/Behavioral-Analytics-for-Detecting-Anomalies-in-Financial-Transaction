# Behavioral-Analytics-for-Detecting-Anomalies-in-Financial-Transaction
* With Limited Labelled Data our Approach is More towards Semi Supervised and Unsupervised Learning(USL).
* Leveraging one of the following USL(Isolation Forest, DBSCAN, and One-Class SVM) for anomaly detection.
* Employing autoencoders for self-supervised learning to capture intricate patterns in unlabelled financial transactions.
* Choosing the most effective approach based on performance of above approach metrics for dynamic fraud detection.
* Balancing anomaly labels using GANs to optimize the limited labelled dataset and improve model generalization.
* Previous NN Approach and Labelled Data can help Validating USL approach.
